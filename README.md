# Music Tools
A python package for representing musical structures.  The features of the musictools module have less to do with audio file production/management, and more with analysis and composition.  However, the concepts represented here could be combined with other music/audio related code to make sophisticated musical projects.  The goal of Music Tools is to be versatile and intuitive to a musician-programmer with practice, representing musical concepts in a way musicians will find familiar, and leaving room to use the information in any way the user wishes, rather than creating any interfaces for programs such as sheet music notation directly.


# Getting started
## Prerequisites
You need an installation of Python 3.6 or higher.  Music Tools uses NumPy, but if your python library doesn't have it, the package will download it automatically.  To make use of this package, you should have a strong grasp of Python's object-oriented programming and a strong grasp on common Western music theory.
## Installation
Music Tools is now part of the PyPI community of python packages.  It's name is 'musictools' for installation/importing.  It's easy to install
Music Tools with a simple pip command from your terminal:

```
$pip install musictools
```
Don't forget to make sure your pip version matches the command for Python version you are using.  (You may need to use a command like pip3, pip3.7, etc.)
